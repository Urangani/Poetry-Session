# Bonds

Bonds   
They are not your family if they’ve ever failed to accept you    
They are not your friends if they’ve never shared bread with you   
Though blood maybe be thicker than water    
The fact is the bonds formed are stronger   
Who is to say these bonds are meant to last forever   
At least what is started is better than what was never
