# Once upon a time, that’s how it all begins

Once upon a time, that’s how it all begins    
The good stuffs with none of the ugly things   
Always starts with the blue birds that know how to sing   
Then the good girls who are mostly slim   
That’s the good stuff, what I am about to tell you is awfully dim   

Welcome to the forest of gloom   
Where is always dark and the trees never bloom   
The trees are filled with fruits you know you should never consume   
Is the garden of Eden one might presume
