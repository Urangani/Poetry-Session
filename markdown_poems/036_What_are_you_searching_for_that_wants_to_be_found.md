# What are you searching for that wants to be found?

What are you searching for that wants to be found?   
What’s so important you had to lose yourself in the search?   
What is it that convinced you that happiness is only found in wealth?   
Soo poisonous that it had to take your health   
Is it the pursuit of happiness?   
If so   
Then you already lost   
The wisdom you thought you had    
The soul you had to preserve   
All lost in the search
