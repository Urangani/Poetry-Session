# Hopes for the beyond

Hopes for the beyond   
Good things ahead maybe not   
Mentally tied up as tight as a knot   
Ideas frozen up nothing hot    
No directions upheld everything lost What about everything taught? Memory blank I guess we forgot Will everything turn up alright.   
Or will everything go dark as the night
