# Black eyed princess


Black eyed princess  

Rebellious in her own ways   
She has never seen the sun she praises,   
Yet she dried out like raisins.   
Claim to know it all,   
Yet oblivious as day Is to night.  
She wants to feel,   
Yet she shrouds like a lemon.  
Tough to peel she has multiple layers.  

Never seen the world she stays locked in.  
Untouched, she is the freshest fruit in the garden.  
Not forbidden but surely hidden.  
Pessimistic to reality her soul is still untainted.   
She bound to break as the walls will crumble.  
Pride as her defence surely, she must be mistaken,  
Because an unpicked fruit is bound to go rotten.  
An unread book is bound to be forgotten.  

Her solitude will disappear with time,  
fade away as the sound of ringing chimes.   
Gone will be the days of her solitude.  
Her soul will a place to belong too.  
………….to be continued never.
