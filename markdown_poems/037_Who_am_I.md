# Who am I?

Who am I?   
Nothing more than just a glimpse in time   
Just another spec   
Like those before me   
I too follow   
To the live the life I am destined or pave my path I choose a gamble with a hefty price to pay a scramble with a ticking clock to race what is it going to be?   
For me and the life I hold dear   
Am I going to be the victor or the defeated?   
Either way in the end   
Is back to the soil which I came
