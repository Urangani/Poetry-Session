# They say


They say  
The blacker the berry the sweeter the sweeter the juice  
Her lips are blacker with plenty of juice.  
She moves so free she is bound by none.  
If heaven can see her then angels are bound to come,  
They will Claim as her own because her soul is so free.  
She is humble and beautiful a princess she might be.  
Be careful she stings, a princess maybe not but the queen of bees.  
She is black from her lips, hips, waist down her knees,  
The true embrace of the color black, she is vicious indeed.  
Yes! She is wild she belongs with the beast,  
The most ferocious yet majestic, a wonder she is,  
Hold your hearts and zip your pants.  
You all don’t deserve her,   
Might as well save your chants.  
She is the epitome of beauty so,  
Sit back and just glance.
