# The lesson

The lesson   
The lesson here is don’t hate what you can’t make.   
You will be swallowed by greed because that’s envy hiding in shade you mind gradually becoming a contemporary slave.   
stuck in the present surfing the envious wave.   
you don’t need to be wise to know,  
 that jealousy Is never a fair trade.   
take its path and you will find that only fools end up astray.  
 you will end up lost courtesy of your attention seeking ways,   
 have pride in what is yours because that’s what you got.  
 Learn to love yours and stop being what you are not.
