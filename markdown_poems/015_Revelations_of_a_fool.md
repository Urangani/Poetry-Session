# Revelations of a fool

Revelations of a fool   
I gave my all I got nothing back   
They told me to give so I can get back.  
I guess I haven’t given enough yet.   
Maybe the nothing was what I was supposed to get.   
Is this lesson learned?   
Or the second time is a charm.   

I then went to church; thought I should repent.   
Never did wrong but I had to give the lord my consent.    
The preacher then said I should give a penny so I could get.   
So, I gave up my arm thought It was better than the leg   
To my surprise I still got nothing back   
Now the only thing I got is a missing is an arm,  
Guess I should have gone for the leg.
