# The Pieces of you cloud my mind.


 The Pieces of you cloud my mind.  
Thinking of you is a visit to cloud nine.  
Heaven should stand back.   
because I proclaim her as mine.  
If she happens to explode, then that’s fine.  
I’ll pick up every piece even if it takes time.  
No matter how broken ill still claim her as mine
