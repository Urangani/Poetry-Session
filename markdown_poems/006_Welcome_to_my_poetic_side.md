# Welcome to my poetic side

Welcome to my poetic side    
Take a glimpse and see what you mind find    
Don’t be expecting something good   
Because this is a shade of hell with a brighter side   
Don’t come thinking I am sincere    
Because I won’t apologize    
I promise to tell you the truth    
You won’t hear lies    
If is about you   
Then is your demise   




















*Urangani T.M*
