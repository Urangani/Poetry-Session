# Cheers

Cheers    
Cheers to those who live to impress    
Word of advice, don’t it will leave you depressed   
You want all the love and respect they give Are you that blind you that you can’t even, see?   
You want to give it all but what will you get back?   
You repeat the same mistake    
Is it wisdom you lack?   
You yourself are the only person you need to impress   
Follow my advice and I promise    
You will bathe in happiness and not a drop of stress
