# Watch the space

Watch the space   
I am not going to be subtle when I walkthrough    
My head is going to be raised high when I walk to   
The place of victors or so where they much to   
Like a winner I am going to stand victorious   
With a smirk of that of a man whose been glorious   
Don’t be stunned the is no title to hold    
Not even a glance of beauty to behold   
I won’t flaunt around when I walk, it will be a walk of spite   
With my head high and my middle finger higher   
It will not be an act of war but the declaration of freedom   
For those who thought I would keep tucked in a hole   
A hole of my own self-induced misery   
And all the petty things that belittled me   
Is the come up as you might presume   
A self-discovery journey to be free   
For all those with prying eyes    
Just watch the space and breathe
