# Jessica

Jessica   
Jessica is a girl who is socially stranded, she is liked by all but loved by none. Or that’s what she thinks anyway   
No one truly knows her but herself    
She is an open book but hard to read    
Filled with plenty of pages all empty    
is she a story waiting to be written?    
Nobody knows only Jessica does
