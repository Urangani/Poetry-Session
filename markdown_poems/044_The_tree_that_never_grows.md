# The tree that never grows

The tree that never grows   

A tree that never grows    
Without proper care it will never bloom   
Never goes anywhere I wonder why   
Well, is a tree, where is sprouted is where it will die   
Its roots hold it down from going away   
Yet it also prevents it from fading away    
This tree could be you   
You could share the same fate or create something new   
Like a spoilt brat that never grew   
Without proper care he will never bloom
