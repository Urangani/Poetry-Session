# She

She    
She is yellow but not mushy as mellow   
She is a dandelion not a rose,   
Red is never her color    
Pure and refined can never be tainted    
An art by herself she is a canvas meant to be painted   
A personality with more than you can ask for    
She is perfect down to her deep core   
With a heart as big as mount Everest   
Hard to climb yet easy to fall for   

Never negative she is just the best   
If you are a hater I say, take a rest   
She is a fruit you never want to digest    
She is the mood you can never forget    
A bonny flower you can never neglect   
Never exceeded is written on her smile   
On braces is also written divine   
With all the things in the world, in the end    
She is much more than just a couple of words    
She is a precious jewel that can never be bought
