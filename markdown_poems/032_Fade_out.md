# Fade out

Fade out   
Everyone sees a brighter future    
Well, I don’t I see a dimmed one    
With shattered dreams and broken hopes   
Everyone dead and dreams hanging on ropes   

I told them dreams are only found in sleep   
I warned that the pain only goes deep   
No escaping what is coming    
Hopes for the few who are cunning Is a rat race so don’t stop running?   

The future has never been kind to fools    
It would have been easier if we knew the rules   
To end this grueling cycle a mercy it would be    
The pitiful will resort to spreading their seed    
A last-ditch resort of a dying breed
