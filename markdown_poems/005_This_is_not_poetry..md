# This is not poetry.

This is not poetry.   
This is just the feelings of a damaged soul.   
A heart that wants to be made whole.    
Is a story of a boy who wants to dream without waking up.  
A boy who doesn’t want to open up.   
He doesn’t want to expose his demons.    
He knows he is a broken entity that wants to be mended    
He is a lost soul which only dreams of being commended.   
A boy who believes he is a god in his mind   
A boy who perceives himself as crazy inside   
He sold his tears for pride.    
He is a soul that that can no longer cry.    
For all those reading, this is not poetry.    
Nothing more than just a short story
