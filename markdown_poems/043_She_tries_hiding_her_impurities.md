# She tries hiding her impurities

She tries hiding her impurities   
It ends up revealing her insecurities   
Leaving her vulnerable to the vultures   
There is nothing they can do but to gaze and admire   
Heart of stone, always mistaken for coal   
Under pressure she won’t break,   
A diamond she will erupt freshly baked   
 A diamond that shines brighter than most   
Glistening as she is, she is still human   
Fragile as glass if she falls, she breaks   
If you look deep, you will see through her
