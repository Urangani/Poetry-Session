# My hate for you

 My hate for you   
I will tell you the reality of your existence   
A pitiful illusion that shows itself as persistent   
It is an awful story so don’t you look pale   
Is a sad note-worthy educational tale   
It begins with a pure sweet beginning as sugar is   
Yet salt is also pure with a bitter feel    
Is a frightening story with a hopeless point,   
A reality with a dark shade and tinted enigma   
A dive into my unapologetic side   
You were a thorn in your mothers’ womb    
A mistake made under the blind moon   
Came out from your mother’s canal as an individual   
From your father’s disgusting residuals    
You became a burden to the mother that you sucked dry   
You were a seed that sprouted and destined to die   
You are a creature that grew and questioned if reality was a lie   
A mortal that denies the rules of deities   
A living corpse whose demise is a mystery    
An animal not far apart from a monkey   
An offspring as stubborn as donkey   
A pathetic being that takes years to evolve   
A functional brain but lacks resolve   
This is nothing personal but a sad truth   
This is not heinous but a rewarding tool   
A piece of mind from a miserable fool   
With a will that refuses bending   
A maniac who considered this an amazing ending   
Who am I?    
Ironically, I am you.
