# Shots taken

Shots taken   
They say the shots never taken; are the ones we never miss What do they expect?   
We were given an unloaded gun    
They took the bullets which were our pride,   

Put us in a cage and hid us from the sun   
Never gave us a chance to spread our wings and fly   
Build us a maize and told us to run   
Tame us then label us as shy   

We are playing an unwritten script   
Tales of the destined to die   
Then they tell us get up when we fall   
How can we when the whole is just a fall
