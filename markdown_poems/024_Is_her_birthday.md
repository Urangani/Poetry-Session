# Is her birthday

Is her birthday                                                                        
Wake the neighbors and wake the dogs   
Let the sing and let them bark   
Is her birthday let them wish her luck   
If possible, call the stars to light the candles with a spark   

Buy some candles, let her blow, and make a wish   
Let her wish for her own galaxy   
Because space is what she needs   
For all who come bearing gifts    
Buy her a physics book because she might be a nerd    
Find her a man because that’s something she never had   

Is her birthday so where being the cake?   
Ask the mother where she hid the cake   
She brought her daughters picture instead of cake   
We asked her why, she replied, “it was no mistake”   
She is the sweetest cake I have ever baked
