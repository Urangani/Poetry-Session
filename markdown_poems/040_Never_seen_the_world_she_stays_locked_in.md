# Never seen the world she stays locked in


Never seen the world she stays locked in   
Untouched she is the freshest fruit in the garden   
Not forbidden but surely hidden   
Pessimistic to reality her soul is still untainted    
She bound to break as the walls will crumble    
Pride as her defense surely, she must be mistaken    
Because an unpicked fruit is bound to go rotten   
An unread book is bound to be forgotten   
She will disappear with the time   
As she fades away with the ringing chimes   
Gone will be the days of her solitude
