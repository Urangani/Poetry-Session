# If love is hell, then for sure I am already damned.

If love is hell, then for sure I am already damned.   
Heaven’s angels watching from above as they see me burn.    
Lost in thought contemplating if this was in the plan.   
To die alone or maybe this is not how it all ends   

Life constantly playing like a movie   
The audience patiently prepared for a new scene will they be satisfied with the true me?    
Maybe this movie is not ready to be seen   

Expecting a brighter future in the dark night   
Reminiscing if all the decisions made were right Praying for the absolute best yet preparing for the worst   
Is this race still worth winning or have I already lost?
