# The dreamer

The dreamer    
Reality is a pain to live in    
So, he escapes into a world where his free    
Free from love and despair    
Free from pain and regrets    
Free to grow and progress    
A place where everything he wants is accessible    
A lucid dream where his untouchable   
But he is just a dreamer
