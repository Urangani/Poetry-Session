# Suffer

Suffer   
Haven’t I suffered enough yet?   
What mental torture haven’t I suffered yet?   
As if growing up was not enough yet   

They said stay in school that’s the endgame,   
Act cool and you will get enough fame    
They who were all social slaves   

I survived being a teenager my biggest feat   
I hid behind depression as I gazed peer pressure feed   
I then became food and let the dopamine feast   

Peeped out the window saw pain and despair as big as the see   
Is a sink or swim humanity is fighting to breathe   
It was clear as white what that meant to me   

Humanity was born to suffer not just me
