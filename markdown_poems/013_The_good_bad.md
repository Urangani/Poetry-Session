# The good bad

The good bad    
I am evil but I got a hero’s smile   
I know I am see- through that’s why I got these blinds   
Don’t ever mistake me as one of the good guys    
I may do good, but my wish is for all humanity to die   
My dark side is always mistaken for being bright    
A perfect way for my demons to hide   

Why are you running towards me?     
Don’t you know you should run away from me?   
I know I am monster inside don’t believe otherwise   
I see you are a fool because you are straying from your pride   
I guess you are not like lions u don’t have pride   
Either way I am still a predator, and you are the prey    
I won’t feel any remorse for hunting you, so you better pray   

Your arrogance will be your downfall   
This time I am the one pushing but you won’t fall   
Still, you believe I am good despite how I told I am no good   
Guess the monster was the wall I built    
U destroyed it know you have built a bridge    
From good to bad that’s how it is   
You are my good side, who would’ve thought u exist.
