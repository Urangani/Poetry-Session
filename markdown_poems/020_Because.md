# Because

Because   
Is because I love you that I would write.   
Is because I met you, I feel all right,   
Is because I saw you, I know it was love at first sight.  
 is because the sky is blue that it rains.  
 is because I see you as beautiful, I won’t lie  
 is because it doesn’t need to make sense for it to rhyme like how all souls are bound to their destined bodies,   
 I know mine is bound for yours   
Like a dog as it chases is own tail   
Round and round that’s how our story goes
