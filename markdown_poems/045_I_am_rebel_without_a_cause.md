# I am rebel without a cause

I am rebel without a cause    
An arsenal of weapons made for war   
A loaded gun with a loose trigger   
With an ego that only grows bigger   

I am the unseen light in the shadows   
I am what you are afraid of in the dark   
I am the flames that burn in hell   
I am your nightmare I am sure that rings a bell   

You flipped the coin so now which side is this?   
Is my bad side, prepare because I am coming to sting.
