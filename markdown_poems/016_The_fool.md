# The fool

The fool   
You are not the first and not the last    
They fooled you once and probably going to fool you again   
In the game of trust, you better bring a bullet proof vest   
They will gun you down even if you raise the white flag   
Don’t be fooled the wicked have no rest   

They fooled you once, such things happen   
They fooled you twice guess the was nothing you could do   
They fooled you thrice, now you are literally just a fool   
You thought you would do right by slaving as a mule   
Now you understand that the world is not kind to fools
