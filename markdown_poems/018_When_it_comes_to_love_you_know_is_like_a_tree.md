# When it comes to love you know is like a tree

When it comes to love you know is like a tree    
It plants a seed, I’m sure you know how that feels   
Give It some time and see what it sprouts    
Its absence feels like a rainy day with drought   
I’m sure you can relate that I don’t doubt   
For those wondering, go fall in love    
And see what I’m rambling about
