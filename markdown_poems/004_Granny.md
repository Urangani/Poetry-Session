# Granny

Granny   
Granny so sweet    
With stories that will make you sleep    
With white hair like milk     
She Once hit me with a stick   
Just because I didn’t want to go sleep   
After her slaps, for sure you won’t even remember a thing    
With an attitude like hers   
She is sure to scare a bear    
With all the grannies in the world    
I am pretty sure that the is no other like her
