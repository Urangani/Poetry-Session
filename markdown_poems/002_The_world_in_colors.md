# The world in colors

The world in colors    
Hate a feeling so faint.    
An emotion no color can paint   
Maybe with a touch of jealousy with pink   
A dash of greed with green   
Painted by an artist with no true experience of pain   
The one painting with the color of rage    
A misuse of the great color red   
Some artist shine with a hint of sunshine yellow   
So bright is refined it feels mellow   
Just maybe If these artists would shed some light    
They would see this beautiful blue world in delight
