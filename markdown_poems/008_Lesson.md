# Lesson

Lesson    
The lesson here is don’t hate what you can’t make    
You will be a fool because that is envy hiding in shade   
Your mind becoming a contemporary slave    
Stuck in the present surfing the envious wave   
You don’t need to be wise to know    
That jealousy is never a fair trade   
Take is path and it will show you not only fools end up astray   
You will end up lost, courtesy of your attention seeking ways    
Have pride in what you have because that’s what you got    
Love yours and stop being what you not
