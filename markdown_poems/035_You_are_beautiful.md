# You are beautiful

You are beautiful   
Beautiful is the word, and you are the subject   
Your beautiful smile is a wonder they haven’t found yet   
You’re beautiful from the core and everywhere elsewhere   
A wondrous gift waiting to be unwrapped   
A perfect being heaven should have kept   
A factual dream that scares of nightmares   
A pleasure so wonderful is like you’re staring at the sunset   
Prickly rose princess caution to all who dare   
Resemble the purest diamond other stones fail to compare   
With all that said, you are beautiful and that ends there
