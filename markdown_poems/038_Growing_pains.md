# Growing pains

Growing pains   
Who would ever think it would come to this?   
I guess it was time   
It was time who stole our youth    
It was time who hid the truth   
Or maybe they are all dreams   
Ironic, twisted dreams   
A dream in which we wake up everyday   
To find out we still dreaming   
Cursed with the search of meaning Guess it was time to grow up and stop dreaming
