# Urangani’s reality

Urangani’s reality   
It is an   
Unrealistic source of life, His  
Reality so mysterious but it’s still alright, is   
A life usually so quiet but mostly at nights   
Nevertheless, still a beautiful gaze    
Graceful with all is undying stars, is   
A reality that dwells in the dark   
Not visible in day   
It only exists once you step into the night    
























*Urangani T.M*
