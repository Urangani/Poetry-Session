# This is for my precious sister.

This is for my precious sister.   

Is her birthday, is the day heaven lost a star.  
Is the day of someone beautiful that is just the start.  
She is a picture out of a canvas, my mother’s finest art.  
She is heavens treasurer just take a glimpse of her heart.  

She is fine wine, she aged well.  
She is older now doesn’t that sound swell.  
Damned not, she is just fine as hell.  
Is her charisma that enchant’s you are not under her spell.  

Is time for the songs is time for the chants.  
Bring the cake let my dear dance.  
Don’t forget is her birthday give the girl a chance.  
Happy birthday, happy birthday  
From today till forever   
You are my precious sister.  
 whom I will always love and treasure.  

Happy birthday Ngudo
