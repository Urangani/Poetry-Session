# First period

First period   
First period I am tired as hell   
I’m pretty sure even the teacher can tell   
All I can do is take a snooze for a minute or two but the keeps staring I know he is no fool   
Closing my eyes now has now become a hassle   
I’m left with daydreaming as the only option   
The teacher keeps asking if I’m understanding or not, I couldn’t tell him I was dreaming so I give him a nod   
The teacher goes on and on    
The body is on autopilot and the mind is off   
The bell ring, brings me back to reality   
Onto the next period there goes my vitality
