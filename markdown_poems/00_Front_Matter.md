Reality, A colorful illusion  
By

Why poetry I do not know either, all I can say it was my way to vent. There is so much the mind can contain but pen and paper make a great backup storage. Poetry just feels right.   
   
This book is journey, is how I see the world from my personal experiences to the heart’s endeavors.   
    
Hope you all reading this relate or somehow be amused.    
Honestly, that’s all up to you.    
Peace out.      
Though this is not the actual book   
Is a sketch of what the actual might be like   
Just for control,
