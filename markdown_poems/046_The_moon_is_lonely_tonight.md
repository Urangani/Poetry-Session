# The moon is lonely tonight

The moon is lonely tonight    
That Makes the two of us    
Should we gaze at each other’s crescent sides?    
Or should I tell you my darkest secrets as dark as tonight morning comes you will be gone with my secrets, hope you keep them locked better you than my mind as a vault
